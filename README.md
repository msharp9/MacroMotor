MacroMotor is a play on words to one of my favorite bots MicroMachine.  Micro
is short for micro management of units in Starcraft (e.g. focus fire, dancing
and kiting).  Macro management is looking at overall strategy.  This bot is a
mixture of rule based instructions and RL models.  The RL agent tries to
optimize the best strategy by choosing between 15 macro actions at each step.

Actions:
build_scout, build_zealot, build_gateway, build_voidray, build_stalker,
build_worker, build_assimilator, build_stargate, build_pylon, defend_nexus,
defend_main, attack_known_enemy_structure, expand, do_nothing, group_up

A lot of the base code for this project comes from Sentdex's tutorial showing
how to build rule based bots from the python-sc2 api.
